        Arabic is a Semitic language spoken primarily across the Arab world. 
        Having emerged in the 1st century, 
        it is named after the Arab people; 
        the term "Arab" was initially used to describe those living in the Arabian Peninsula, 
        as perceived by geographers from ancient Greece.
